<H3>What is AiConnect?</H3>

AiConnect (abbreviated AIC).

AiConnect is a new cryptocurrency which aims to become the best alternative to current popular coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum by employing the Proof of Stake model which greatly reduces the power requirements to mint our coins.

It is a form of digital public money created by complex mathematical computations and validated by millions of computer users (blockchain technology).

AiConnect coins are digital coins which you can store on your computer drive, smartphone, hardware wallet or somewhere in the cloud.

Once you own aiConnect coins, they behave like physical gold coins: they possess value and can be traded like stocks in popular exchanges. In the future you'll be able to use them to purchase goods and services.

<H1>Repo Guidelines</H1>

Developers work in their own forks, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.
If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the development team members simply pulls it.
If it is a more complicated or potentially controversial change, then the change may be discussed in the pull request, or the requester may be asked to start a discussion in the aiConnect Forum for a broader community discussion.
The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt) or are controversial.
From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will be used to issue a warning of closure. Pull requests closed in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.
